# insider-trading
Using Selenium to perform web scraping for insider trades and pandas datareader to collect real-time stock data.
As a result, we are able to identify when insider trades were performed, the volume of the insider trades, as well as the closing price and moving average stock price for the relevant tickers when the insider trades happened.

Using a shell script to ease the process of data collection to execute the relevant python files. To ensure shell script can be run on Mac via double-click, use .command extension, as well as the following Terminal command `chmod u+x /path/to/file.command` to mitigate any access privilege errors.
